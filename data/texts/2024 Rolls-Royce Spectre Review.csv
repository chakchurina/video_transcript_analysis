0,Hello.,0.52
1,"As you can probably hear, we're in the middle of a city.",3.5
2,"Because today, instead of doing a normal video like a road test or a track test or a drag race or something like that, we're going to go on a little bit of a mini throttle house adventure.",11.08
3,"Yeah, because we featured Rolls Royces before, and they're fancy, but the Spectre is a slightly different beast, one that they're still charging half a million dollars for.",10.14
4,"And if you're a half-million-dollar passenger car, you have to be the best, the superlative.",6.42
5,"That's a number that makes everyone from the nation this is made say, oh, blimey, I've got a cheap charge on that.",7.48
6,Bloody hell.,0.82
7,I'll just translate that.,0.92
8,"It's very bold of them to charge that much money, isn't it?",4.44
9,Bloody hell.,0.42
10,Wow.,0.6
11,"Yeah, so we've devised four tests that we think represent the four pillars of what makes a Rolls Royce a Rolls Royce.",8.54
12,That is the ultimate motor car.,3.08
13,The ultimate motor car.,2.54
14,It's my voice.,0.4
15,It's my voice.,0.36
16,It's my announcer voice.,0.94
17,It's my voice.,0.96
18,They're used to hearing it.,0.9
19,"No, I know.",0.34
20,You're just mad that your voice can't go that low.,1.54
21,"No, it can.",0.52
22,The ultimate.,1.42
23,The ultimate motor car.,1.48
24,"No, you can't do it.",0.58
25,That's why I did the line.,0.8
26,You see?,0.24
27,Rolls Royce.,0.46
28,It's a Rolls Royce.,0.54
29,"Even though its starting price puts it between the Ghost and the Phantom, the Spectre, in more ways than one, is a successor to the Phantom Coupe, a car that Rolls-Royce say was their previously sexiest offering.",15.34
30,"A car that, like many Rolls Royces before and after it, had the beating heart of a carefully designed V12 silky engine.",9.06
31,"So we have to wonder, has some of that magic gone, because the new Spectre is a pure EV.",6.72
32,"Rolls can use all the fancy terminology they want, but now the chasm in propulsion technology between this half million dollar Rolls Royce and, I don't know, a Kia, is narrower than ever.",13.56
33,"So for Rolls to really wow us now, it must pass these tests with flying colours, starting with the cornerstone of the brand, effortlessness.",14.96
34,What is effortlessness?,8.8
35,Effortlessness.,0.68
36,Effortlessness.,0.5
37,Yes.,0.36
38,"So we've always said, when we've tackled the luxury stuff, that the pinnacle of luxury is minimum input, maximum output.",7.98
39,"So as a driver or a passenger of this car, I don't want to part with one calorie.",5.6
40,No.,0.18
41,Nothing must be burned.,1.08
42,I don't want to feel tension in my neck as we accelerate.,2.32
43,I just want to melt.,1.76
44,I want to feel boneless.,1.16
45,I am immediately melting in this car.,2.66
46,It's just instantly different.,3.04
47,"It's instantly different, James, to anything else that you drive.",2.84
48,"The steering's light as well, even for the driver.",2.0
49,"Oh, it should be.",0.56
50,A Rolls Royce must be piloted with one pinky.,2.92
51,That's probably in the book.,1.06
52,I just made that up.,0.5
53,Easily.,0.3
54,Easily.,0.48
55,Look at you go.,1.02
56,"Oh, that's just crazy, isn't it?",1.88
57,"This thing weighs over 6,000 pounds and you have turned it around a corner with a pinky finger.",5.56
58,I think I may have lost three calories there.,1.78
59,It's unacceptable.,0.84
60,But the other thing is the effortlessness in power because we've lost the V12.,5.64
61,We have.,0.38
62,The twin turbo V12.,1.32
63,The twin turbo V12.,0.74
64,Now we are down to just electric motors.,2.9
65,Yes.,0.18
66,577 horsepower.,1.54
67,Yep.,0.02
68,"Actually, that cut in harder than I thought it would.",2.48
69,I was expecting Rolls Royce to attenuate our acceleration a little bit more than that.,5.34
70,You can feel the weight on braking.,3.02
71,You can feel that.,0.7
72,That's rapid.,0.72
73,"properly That is fast, yeah.",1.14
74,I was not expecting that.,1.2
75,0-60 in just under four and a half seconds.,1.8
76,"I'm pretty sure that the guy that gave us the presentation of this car was like, oh, we don't want passengers.",3.92
77,"No, he said we don't want two point something seconds.",2.64
78,Right.,0.3
79,So four seconds or near abouts in an EV still feels crazy quick.,4.94
80,Yeah.,0.18
81,I mash it.,1.16
82,It's still smooth.,1.86
83,"Oh, this is...",0.7
84,"That's actually a little bit unnerving, honestly.",2.04
85,OK.,0.38
86,"Well, you're not going to believe how fast that was just then.",2.48
87,This might win the prize for hiding speed even more than like the M5s.,4.64
88,Right.,0.62
89,That was mad.,1.18
90,"I'm sorry, Toronto police.",1.1
91,"I mean, we went...",1.72
92,For nothing.,0.48
93,Because we were going exactly 100 kilometers an hour.,2.1
94,Yeah.,0.18
95,But that was...,0.72
96,I looked down and we had already decelerated for a couple seconds and I saw the speed.,3.46
97,As long as you're in the fast lane.,0.84
98,It did absolutely not feel...,3.32
99,"Oh, wow.",1.26
100,That is...,0.82
101,"Look, you know what?",0.74
102,That's probably the ultimate expression of effortlessness I think I've ever seen.,2.92
103,No.,0.18
104,True effortlessness is how a Rolls Royce deals with tarmacular adversity.,5.08
105,Wait.,0.36
106,Before we do that...,1.68
107,Oh.,0.4
108,James?,0.32
109,Yeah?,0.2
110,I'm wafting by the CN Tower.,1.92
111,You are.,0.38
112,In a gold Rolls Royce.,0.8
113,In a gold Rolls Royce.,1.22
114,Let's go find some more challenging roads.,1.78
115,OK.,0.16
116,All right.,0.2
117,We're going to turn off.,0.62
118,Rogers.,0.28
119,Here we are.,0.82
120,Tram-lined.,1.12
121,Yeah.,0.2
122,We've picked the right city.,1.14
123,We've picked the right city.,0.6
124,Yeah.,0.18
125,Terrible roads.,0.66
126,These are terrible roads.,0.88
127,"I know everyone from Michigan to New Orleans who's saying, well, come to where I live.",4.04
128,No.,0.18
129,It's bad.,0.5
130,It's real bad here.,1.0
131,It really is.,0.64
132,Every single car that we test where I live isn't really a problem.,4.38
133,"And James goes, it's horrible.",0.9
134,It's horrible on Toronto Road.,1.12
135,I can't.,0.76
136,I just can't do it.,0.82
137,Every single time.,1.34
138,"This is not one of those cars though, is it?",1.3
139,No.,0.22
140,This is really quite lovely.,1.08
141,You're aware of the surface of the road.,1.68
142,It's not complete isolation.,2.04
143,This doesn't actually have dampers for its dampers like the Ghost does.,3.82
144,Apparently it doesn't need it.,1.0
145,It doesn't need them.,0.54
146,30% more torsional rigidity.,2.04
147,"Whatever it is, it is as good, if not better, than any other Rolls we've driven.",5.2
148,It does the Rolls thing where they're not afraid of a little bit of rebound on the suspension.,5.34
149,"It's not so German and it's like, no, you're done now.",4.12
150,"It's very, it just lets the car move and just float over top of all of the bumps.",6.22
151,It's the signature.,1.22
152,It's the characteristic of the Rolls Royce.,1.7
153,It's Bruce Lee.,0.46
154,Bruce Lee actually helped design this particular car.,2.04
155,"He said, be like water, my friend.",1.68
156,"Ah, I see.",0.66
157,"Fluid, yeah.",0.6
158,Flow over the rocks.,0.82
159,"We're going over cracks, bumps, tram lines, and there's just like, I can feel it ever so slightly in my arms.",7.38
160,But I think that's only because of the absence of all other types of vibrations.,5.38
161,Look at that.,0.2
162,"We just went through about 19 tram lines, streetcar things, and you, it's barely, it's barely.",6.26
163,"This is passing with flying colors so far, I will say.",2.66
164,On effortlessness?,0.28
165,On effortlessness?,0.68
166,Yes.,0.22
167,All right.,0.12
168,That's the end of chapter one.,1.16
169,Chapter two.,1.62
170,The car is effortless.,1.1
171,Silence is golden.,2.72
172,"Okay, so needless to say, it is very quiet in here.",4.52
173,Very quiet indeed.,0.34
174,We're under a bridge.,1.58
175,There's streetcars going past.,2.32
176,The loudest thing is the brakes.,1.48
177,"But if you are, for some reason, not married to the sound of silence and complete isolation, Rolls Royce now has a Rolls Royce sound for this electric car that generates EV sound.",10.2
178,"A little bit of EV noise, yeah.",1.92
179,"So if I accelerate here, it's a bit orchestral.",6.62
180,"They said it's not Hans Zimmer, but it's, it's derivative.",2.3
181,He could have done it.,1.18
182,He could have.,0.44
183,Hold on.,0.32
184,"I just want, there's a bus.",0.7
185,"Yeah, I know.",0.5
186,You ready?,0.64
187,You ready to experience this?,0.8
188,All right.,0.26
189,Ready?,0.24
190,This is crazy.,1.74
191,You know what though?,0.44
192,"I feel like that's not good enough of a test to test the sound isolation because I don't know if you remember, but when we first drove a Rolls Royce Phantom, we were in Los Angeles and we drove by a concert hall, like a rock concert was going on.",13.52
193,Yeah.,0.04
194,And I'll never forget it.,1.2
195,We had no idea.,1.04
196,Someone waved to us and wanted to say hi.,2.36
197,So we put the window down and literally it was like walking into a room with a band playing.,5.5
198,I could not believe the difference between the window up and the window down.,3.92
199,And I kind of want to test that.,2.18
200,I'm going to recreate that.,1.06
201,I think you can recreate that.,1.04
202,I am literally going to recreate it.,2.36
203,Turn right up here.,1.52
204,Check it out.,3.76
205,What's going on?,0.54
206,"Steve's music, famous music store.",1.78
207,Yeah.,0.18
208,I called ahead and set this up.,1.86
209,It's ridiculous.,0.74
210,I'm just recreating.,1.2
211,I'm recreating the moment in LA.,1.04
212,I want to do it for real.,0.78
213,Okay.,0.34
214,They're going to play music.,1.06
215,We're going to put the window down and then up and we're going to see just how silent it actually gets.,6.02
216,Okay.,0.28
217,This is as real as it gets.,1.44
218,Yeah.,0.34
219,It's ridiculous.,0.3
220,Get in the car.,0.62
221,Get in the car.,0.42
222,Is it good?,4.06
223,"Alright, here we go.",0.96
224,"That is absolutely insane, literally three feet, ready?",6.36
225,This is the coolest test we've ever done on Bottle House.,5.96
226,"That does not, that is outrageous.",5.84
227,That is outrageous.,1.9
228,"No, it's good.",1.02
229,"It's a public disturbance, but it's a private enterprise in here, wow.",10.52
230,"That is, I'm shaking.",1.2
231,"I did not expect it to be that much of a light switch, window equipment.",2.84
232,was so That awesome.,0.64
233,Okay.,0.76
234,"All right, science.",0.76
235,Moving on.,1.08
236,Science is golden.,0.68
237,Jesus.,0.24
238,What's chapter three?,0.82
239,Let's find out.,1.02
240,It's what's on the inside that counts.,2.54
241,"All right, quick recap.",1.94
242,So we have established that the car is indeed quite quiet.,3.16
243,Quite quiet.,0.5
244,Quite quiet indeed.,0.76
245,"And from a perspective of smoothness and power and ride, everything is calibrated perfectly.",8.4
246,"As far as I can tell, driving it right now, it feels exactly like the best possible tuned version of a Rolls Royce that had a twin turbo V12.",9.82
247,But there are two pillars left.,1.16
248,There are two pillars.,0.86
249,Very important ones.,1.04
250,And it's what's on the inside that counts because your experience of this car is from here.,5.48
251,It is.,0.4
252,"And now that we're in the Spectre, there's a new thing.",2.46
253,We get starlight doors.,2.94
254,"Okay, listen, I got a problem.",2.46
255,What is Rolls Royce's thing?,2.68
256,What is that special phrase that they always say?,2.6
257,"You feel like you've spent, you got the money's worth.",2.7
258,Got the money's worth.,0.88
259,"That doesn't sound like from a Rolls Royce press release, does it?",2.1
260,"No, I know.",0.18
261,I feel like they're a little bit more eloquent than that.,1.76
262,"4,796 stars laid these doors.",3.14
263,"No, it's not good enough because- No, because there's 5,000 in the ceiling.",3.04
264,No.,0.22
265,"There's another 5,000 here.",1.1
266,"That's 15,000 stars, Thomas.",1.66
267,I have two words for you.,1.12
268,You're going to be a star.,0.84
269,Post-opulence.,1.38
270,It should be absolutely understated.,3.3
271,And don't get me wrong.,0.78
272,Some of it is.,0.62
273,"For example, this gauge cluster tells me literally nothing.",2.84
274,"Well, that gauge cluster is actually from factory digitally yellow.",4.88
275,Yeah.,0.18
276,Or gold.,0.52
277,Yeah.,0.12
278,That's pretty- You have to choose when you specify your vehicle what color your gauge cluster is.,6.44
279,And you can't change it now.,1.0
280,You can't change it.,0.54
281,You can't change it.,0.7
282,"So you must choose the digital color, even though with a single button.",3.32
283,But the thing is that Rolls wants to minimize buttons.,2.98
284,"In fact, this infotainment system, which is based off of BMWs, is aggressively simplified.",6.2
285,It is.,0.24
286,Aggressively simplified.,0.68
287,"The first time we ever had a Rolls Royce, which was a Phantom, the infotainment showed a 7 Series in the screen.",6.74
288,Yes.,0.3
289,"But we've tested this, and now, not only does it show the vehicle we're in, it's the same color as our vehicle.",5.68
290,"It is actually a Spectre, and it is in our color.",1.94
291,Even in the 3D parking.,1.1
292,So that's a pass.,1.02
293,That's a pass.,0.6
294,Yes.,0.3
295,"Listen, you're talking about beautifully stitched stuff.",2.2
296,You've got stitching on the stalks.,2.48
297,"Yes, the stalks are very nice.",1.76
298,The whole thing.,0.54
299,"15,000 stars, Thomas.",1.2
300,How many stars are in the galaxy?,1.66
301,Too many stars.,0.68
302,How many stars in the Milky Way?,0.56
303,Billions and billions and billions.,1.66
304,"It might be, yes, like 400 billion.",1.24
305,Yes.,0.26
306,"So it's less than that, and therefore, not too flashy.",2.5
307,"No, because I promise you that you can do absolute comfort, because you agree these seats are incredibly comfortable.",6.58
308,They're very comfortable.,0.64
309,And we've tested the rear seats.,1.14
310,Yes.,0.2
311,And they're incredibly comfortable.,1.14
312,There's space in the back there.,0.4
313,Yes.,0.24
314,"So, yeah, you can do comfort and understated classiness while using absolutely the best materials that you can buy.",9.32
315,You know what?,0.36
316,I'm going to prove it to you.,0.92
317,Is there another band somewhere?,1.64
318,Where are we?,0.32
319,Mjölk.,0.32
320,Mjölk.,0.76
321,Mjölk.,0.38
322,Isn't that the hammer from Thor?,1.44
323,"No, no.",0.64
324,Mjölk.,0.32
325,We're going to Mjölk.,0.88
326,That's a metaphor.,1.82
327,So we're going to Mjölk.,0.88
328,Yep.,0.18
329,Mjölk.,0.44
330,Mjölk.,0.38
331,What is it?,0.62
332,It's Mjölk.,0.9
333,"Well, first of all, it's fun to say.",1.08
334,"Yeah, Mjölk.",0.54
335,"Second of all, it is a furniture store.",1.68
336,Yeah.,0.24
337,That I found on the internet.,1.06
338,Right.,0.38
339,"And they make furniture that proves that you can have something that is comfortable, well-made, and understated.",7.98
340,All right.,0.46
341,Go ahead.,0.36
342,Let's do it.,0.42
343,All right.,2.92
344,In you go.,0.8
345,Okay.,0.3
346,Yeah.,0.4
347,See?,0.32
348,You're in the land of minimalism.,3.28
349,I think it's that.,0.7
350,Mjolnililism.,0.88
351,Mjolnililism.,1.32
352,Are those spoons?,0.82
353,"Oh, here it is.",0.64
354,Here it is.,0.38
355,"Come, come, come, come, come, sit.",1.06
356,Okay?,0.24
357,This is a chair.,0.66
358,This is the whiskey chair.,1.84
359,Okay.,0.38
360,All right.,0.56
361,All right?,0.2
362,This has a little bit right here.,1.1
363,It folds out.,0.6
364,It comes with a glass for enjoying your whiskey.,2.6
365,"Now, this is handmade in Denmark with walnut, okay?",4.08
366,And it's got rawhide as the leather.,2.68
367,"Now, just like a Rolls Royce, the expectation of quality for this leather is of the utmost.",6.44
368,Right.,0.24
369,Which means that they actually wrap the posts in the field where the cows live so that they can't be scarred or marked by any sort of cuts or abrasions.,8.22
370,"Well, these cows live a good life.",1.22
371,Right?,0.14
372,"Now, answer these questions.",0.64
373,Is this comfortable?,0.86
374,"Yeah, it's comfortable.",0.48
375,Yeah.,0.08
376,Yes.,0.36
377,Does it feel well-made?,1.28
378,Very well-made.,0.64
379,Do you feel fancy?,0.76
380,I feel like I read a book.,2.96
381,Right.,0.24
382,Yeah.,0.2
383,Do you see an LED light anywhere?,2.22
384,No.,0.82
385,Right.,0.36
386,There you go.,0.48
387,How much is this?,0.66
388,"$20,000.",0.56
389,That's ridiculous.,0.68
390,Yeah.,0.12
391,Okay.,0.34
392,"So, I get your point, but I'm looking here.",2.96
393,"You don't have to do the starlight, the hand-placed stars in the doors.",4.56
394,Okay.,0.38
395,There's an option for Cannadale Wood.,1.8
396,What's Cannadale Wood?,1.2
397,I don't know.,0.38
398,Cannadale Wood.,0.68
399,You're in the...,0.78
400,He's nuts.,0.72
401,World-class car reviewer.,2.3
402,Cannadale Wood is Rolls-Royce's alternative.,3.82
403,"So, instead of...",1.28
404,"Okay, we're stopped.",0.4
405,Let me see the photo.,0.48
406,Okay.,0.24
407,Okay.,1.96
408,That's pretty milky.,1.26
409,That's pretty milky.,0.72
410,That's pretty milky.,0.66
411,All right.,0.58
412,Fair enough.,0.38
413,All right.,0.2
414,I wouldn't...,0.92
415,It's Rolls-Royce with a J.,0.56
416,Rolls-Royce.,0.92
417,Rolls-Royce.,1.1
418,Yeah.,0.12
419,I wouldn't do this personally.,1.98
420,I think it's a bit too much.,1.58
421,But you can only get it on the Spectre.,1.42
422,You can only get it on the Spectre.,1.14
423,Okay.,0.28
424,I get it.,0.38
425,"Listen, the lights are very cool.",1.18
426,Here's the thing.,0.46
427,"The Starry Night headliner, which, as usual, is stunning.",2.5
428,Also hand-placed.,0.86
429,But it was the upper limit.,2.34
430,It was the upper limit of what is...,2.0
431,It was borderline tacky.,1.62
432,It was borderline tacky.,1.64
433,And now we've gone too far with this.,1.68
434,So I would not option this personally.,2.02
435,I would get Cannondale Deez Nuts wood.,2.54
436,Cannondale Deez Nuts wood.,1.5
437,"But yes, otherwise, the rest of it in here is very similar to every other Rolls-Royce we've driven.",5.08
438,"That is, everything is, you know, chrome-plated, extraordinarily high quality.",5.74
439,"We've got off, soft, medium, and high for the fan setting, which...",4.72
440,You've got the power reserve instead of the rev gauge.,2.78
441,I don't need a rev gauge.,0.78
442,I just need to know how much power I have left.,1.64
443,"I put my foot down, which actually makes sense in an EV more than it does in an actual engine.",4.12
444,And they haven't done anything too weird.,1.06
445,There's nothing...,0.76
446,"Because it's an EV, it's not...",2.16
447,There's not weird tech.,1.04
448,There's not the crazy dash in the new EQS.,3.28
449,"No, what they have done is they've just made it a Rolls-Royce.",3.22
450,"That's what we wanted them to do with the 7 Series, them, BMW.",3.26
451,Yeah.,0.22
452,And they actually did.,0.9
453,They did.,0.42
454,The 7 Series.,0.68
455,So more manufacturers are starting to get it.,2.38
456,Yes.,0.24
457,Stop making it something crazy and futuristic.,2.14
458,Just give us an EV version of the car we already love.,3.68
459,"Speaking of a car that we already love, I feel like we're not the only people that have been enjoying this car today.",5.02
460,I can't believe how much attention...,1.08
461,I can't decide whether it's because it's gold or...,2.7
462,There's no way everyone knows this is the new Spectre.,2.34
463,No.,0.06
464,They're just seeing a Rolls-Royce.,1.2
465,"Anyway, let's pull over and take a look.",1.5
466,Yeah.,0.2
467,"Me, me, me, me.",1.32
468,"I won, as usual.",3.66
469,"Okay, listen.",0.92
470,"Before we talk about whether or not this passed the final test, that is, you know, whether or not it has the presence of a Rolls and it makes you feel like you're a Rolls-Royce owner.",10.38
471,"Because that's the fourth pillar, right?",0.7
472,That's the fourth pillar.,0.74
473,The intangible.,0.52
474,How do you feel when you're in or near a Rolls-Royce?,2.88
475,Because you could argue that 300 grand gets us to the three pillars.,3.48
476,"Yes, it does.",0.68
477,Where's the extra 200?,1.08
478,Okay.,0.36
479,"So before we do that, though, I just want to reiterate a few things.",2.68
480,"Because as far as I can tell, has this car not passed all three of our tests pretty much perfectly?",3.96
481,Annoyingly.,0.48
482,Annoyingly.,0.42
483,"Usually we're like, oh, it failed this and it sucks at that.",2.72
484,"But unfortunately, the EV powertrain fits the Rolls-Royce thing.",4.44
485,Yes.,0.3
486,"Weight, with one minor caveat.",2.02
487,"Well, actually two.",0.46
488,I have two.,0.36
489,I liked that when Rolls-Royce did a twin turbocharged V12 so well that it felt like an EV.,6.9
490,"It's like this, like, ooh, this car feels like an EV.",2.18
491,I don't miss it.,0.56
492,You don't?,0.26
493,No.,0.24
494,"First of all, I felt like that was trying to be this.",2.8
495,Yeah.,0.22
496,"And also, contraceptively?",3.18
497,Nope.,0.36
498,Nope.,0.26
499,Nope.,0.22
500,I think controversially.,0.96
501,Controversially.,0.64
502,Yeah.,0.2
503,"Hey, it might also be a contraceptive if you get an EV.",2.26
504,I don't think that V12 sounded that good.,1.98
505,"Well, it wasn't supposed to sound like anything.",1.22
506,It was supposed to sound like this.,0.84
507,That is nothing.,0.32
508,But what you could hear didn't sound that good.,1.54
509,"That's fair, yeah.",0.64
510,And what did we read?,1.44
511,"We read in the press release, amongst all the ridiculous jargon that Rolls-Royce uses, that a hundred years ago, Mr.",8.38
512,Rolls and Mr.,0.92
513,Royce said that the electric car was going to be the future with its silence and its composure.,5.32
514,I'm paraphrasing.,0.68
515,Yeah.,0.24
516,"And a century later, the lazy Brits managed to do it.",4.38
517,I think England won a World Cup closer to him saying that than to this car existing.,5.62
518,I think you're probably right.,0.92
519,But here's the other thing.,1.04
520,What is one of the main...,1.08
521,We've already talked about this.,0.62
522,What are the main pillars of luxury?,1.6
523,Effortlessness.,0.56
524,Effortlessness.,0.52
525,And what is it?,1.26
526,Minimum?,0.42
527,Minimum input to maximum output.,1.64
528,"And I will say that if you do run out of juice, you can't fix the problem in five minutes.",5.64
529,And that sounds like an inconvenience to me.,2.42
530,It has fast charging.,1.1
531,"If you happen to be in a place that doesn't have a lot of charging stations, you will at some point, you must be inconvenienced unless you literally have hired someone to take care of the whole thing and you never go more than a hundred kilometers from your house.",10.22
532,But you can go more than that.,0.92
533,I think this range is pretty good.,1.04
534,It is actually pretty good.,0.82
535,Yeah.,0.12
536,"Well, I mean, it's not that hard to fit that much range in the car when it is...",4.24
537,It just keeps going all the way back here.,3.08
538,"It has 700 kilograms of batteries, which I think is like 1,500 pounds give or take.",4.66
539,"And Rolls-Royce say that that not only helps it with the center of gravity, but it adds instant sound insulation.",6.7
540,"Yes, it does.",0.36
541,"I don't think I've heard any other EV manufacturer swing it as like, no, that's actually 1,500 pounds of sound insulation.",7.66
542,"Yeah, we planned this from the start.",1.42
543,"I mean, to be fair to them, when they built the architecture of luxury, which this is on, they did plan for the EV.",5.32
544,"So instead of having to cram batteries somewhere in the front or the back, they just put them underneath.",6.06
545,"Well, this fit.",0.56
546,Yeah.,0.1
547,"And this has the widest grill of any Rolls-Royce, so it might be on the same platform.",4.1
548,Like this way?,0.74
549,Yeah.,0.22
550,Yeah.,0.08
551,"No, I think that they nailed the styling.",1.86
552,I don't know if we've mentioned the color enough.,1.34
553,"Well, come over here and look, because when you stand right here with the sun directly behind you, you get the goldness.",4.82
554,"Well, this color is chartreuse.",1.4
555,What is it?,0.36
556,Chartreuse.,0.58
557,I feel like you're not saying that right.,1.82
558,Chartreuse.,0.56
559,Okay.,0.22
560,It sounds like a sneeze.,1.3
561,Gesundheit.,1.1
562,Yeah.,0.18
563,Am I crazy?,1.2
564,I see a strong RS5 C pillar.,3.34
565,Just this bit right here?,1.38
566,"Yeah, I really see RS5.",0.76
567,"Yeah, there's a little bit of RS5 in there.",1.6
568,But it is a giant car.,1.22
569,It is massive.,0.52
570,rear needs It wheel steer.,0.6
571,It has 23-inch rims.,1.62
572,And this often is going to be seen in two-tone.,2.6
573,I think they made the Spectre with two-tone in mind.,1.8
574,"But I think in full gold with a bit of olive tint, I don't know.",5.8
575,"It is, listen.",1.18
576,It is.,0.04
577,It has a lot of presence.,1.04
578,It absolutely has a lot of presence.,1.72
579,And we have got so much attention in this car.,3.14
580,Yeah.,0.18
581,You pretty much can't go anywhere with it.,1.48
582,It has been posted to the local Toronto car spotting group when we were at Steve's Music.,3.68
583,Within minutes?,1.0
584,Within minutes.,0.36
585,Yeah.,0.54
586,It's literally since you've watched that.,1.34
587,It has happened.,0.5
588,But we're not in those pictures.,1.1
589,I don't feel seen enough.,1.4
590,That's where the money is?,1.14
591,What's the title of the chapter?,0.9
592,"Me, me, me, me.",1.72
593,"Me, me, yeah.",0.78
594,"Mine, mine, mine, mine.",1.86
595,"Now, now, now.",1.54
596,All right.,0.72
597,Joey.,0.42
598,Dustin Hoffman.,0.66
599,Come on.,0.48
600,Okay.,0.3
601,So you are what?,0.96
602,I present to you gold flaked doughnuts.,3.74
603,Have one.,0.78
604,There you go.,0.32
605,This is 24 carat gold.,2.02
606,I don't want to know how much this is.,1.78
607,Why are they so small?,1.48
608,A pack of these doughnuts was $55.,2.32
609,That's disgraceful.,1.06
610,It is disgraceful.,0.58
611,But this might do the trick.,1.78
612,You think this isn't enough on its own?,1.24
613,This isn't enough on its own.,0.82
614,You want to make this a more Instagrammable moment?,1.8
615,All right.,0.2
616,Hang on.,0.36
617,Hold on.,0.1
618,We've got Instagram.,0.5
619,"Oh, you want to?",0.46
620,Okay.,0.24
621,Yeah.,0.26
622,Okay.,0.74
623,With the rolls.,0.58
624,"The car's so big, we can't actually get it in the shot.",1.96
625,You ready?,0.26
626,Yeah.,0.24
627,Go.,0.2
628,Okay.,1.06
629,All right.,0.32
630,Hopefully someone else takes our picture.,1.06
631,I got stuff.,0.8
632,Hi.,0.42
633,This is the extra 200 gram.,1.48
634,This is the whole way.,0.88
635,Fourth pillar to be seen.,1.28
636,These suck.,1.16
637,All right.,2.6
638,All right.,0.02
639,That was an interesting day.,2.3
640,A day of loud noises and quiet ones.,7.74
641,Brash colours and soft bumps.,2.44
642,The Spectre is a masterclass in luxury.,3.5
643,One that filled us with as much satisfaction to cart around in as it did guilt.,5.36
644,Sort of how first class passengers on a flight must feel as the regular folk shuffle past them during the boarding process.,7.4
645,Even just the little things make it feel special.,3.7
646,"Like the magnetic mechanism of the boot compartment or the feel of the release handle to get into the back seats, which despite its sloping roof, can comfortably seat adults.",11.24
647,Unless they're six foot six.,1.54
648,Every part of it oozes an unmatched quality.,3.94
649,It feels three levels above anything else on the road.,3.16
650,And Mr.,0.78
651,"Charles Rolls may have been a century ahead of his time because in losing its combustion engine, the Rolls-Royce Spectre has actually levelled up the passenger experience.",11.6
652,So is it a Rolls-Royce?,2.56
653,Yeah.,0.84
654,The best we've ever operated.,1.78
655,Worth the half a million?,1.52
656,"I mean, what is money anyway?",3.48
657,Sure.,0.4
658,"If they chuck in some 24 karat gold donuts and some Instagram followers, we're in.",5.84
659,Thanks for watching.,1.08
