# Welcome to the Rask AI take-home explorative assignment

## "What can I find out about my transcripts?"
The objective of this assignment is to analyse the given transcripts. 
You received 5 transcripts from 5 videos (you can find the video links in `transcripts/links.txt`).

In particular, since we are in the field of creating, editing and transforming video content, it is very important for us to understand the actual content of our videos. Therefore, in this task you should analyse the transcripts (**not necessarily all of them**) to try and understand the content of the videos better, to try and segment the content of the videos, to try and identify interesting parts of the content and so on.

## What is provided:
1. You are provided with 5 transcripts in (`transcripts/``)
2. You are provided with an entry file `main.py` that has an example output provided for you.
3. `main.py` uses the utils file `utils.py`, where you have basic data loading functionality provided.

## Potential Objectives
Overall, we are looking for an open-ended study of this data and what interesting insights you can find and provide. (I.e. this is an "Unsupervised Learning / Data Exploration Task")

A few examples might be:
1. Clustering the main themes of the transcripts
2. Identifying and Segmenting the Video according to Topics
3. Identifying Particularly interesting parts of the video

## How can the output look like:
Overall, this is left to you. We are not expecting a long report, however, results, some visualisations, and good insights would be interesting.

Potentially the output could be a document that includes:
1. A short section (in bullet-points) with 1-3 results (e.g. Topics / themes identified)
    - Both the actual resuls
    - An attempt to measure the quality of the results
    - ...
2. Possibly a few visualisations to represent your results and insights
3. A manual inspection of these results and insights that can be gained from this( e.g.: model performance, data quality, how to use these results, etc.)

## What methods can / should you use:
This part is really left to you. Feel free to use LLMs or classical tools. Perhaps both approaches can be tried for different aspects. (Again we do not want to over-burden you.)


## Enjoy and Have fun.
